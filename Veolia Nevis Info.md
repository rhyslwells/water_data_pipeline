Dunfermline is our main Scottish office where we have numerous contracts working form it, as well as our finance team.

Veolia Nevis are a small team of 14 who provide water and waste water services to the MoD via a 25yr PFI known as project Aquatrine. Our team delivers the operational side of the business, as well as the capital plan which decides what assets we will upgrade/replace each year to bring our assets up to a contractual condition grade.

One of my responsibilities is the data collection and reporting from our water data loggers / meters around the estate. It is the data from consumption that we are collecting. The role will be reporting directly to myself, collating this information and reporting to our client. Data is mostly csv files and excel sheets. The business wishes to become more digital so we will be also looking to progress various aspects of our work via pronto forms or similar apps so familiarisation of these would be good. There is also a wish to report via power BI, so you would also be developing this. We are pretty 'old school' at the moment so there is an opportunity to really provide great solutions to make gathering / reporting easier.

There are no other data persons within our business unit.

Would be working from the Dunfermline office 2-3 days a week and WFH when not in.

A requirement of the contract is to have a full UK drivers licence and to obtain valid security clearance (SC). Car allowance given as you would also be required to attend MoD sites to enhance you knowledge of the contract. Also be assisting other members of the team to when required, either with their reporting, or out on site.

It is a varied contract and our sites are all over Scotland.
