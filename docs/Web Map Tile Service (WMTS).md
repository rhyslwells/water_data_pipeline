### Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)

**Purpose**: WMTS is designed to serve pre-rendered, cached image tiles of maps. 

**Functionality**:
- **Tile-Based**: It serves map images as small, fixed-size tiles, usually in a format such as PNG or JPEG.
- **Performance**: By using cached tiles, WMTS can quickly deliver map images, making it highly efficient for applications requiring fast map rendering, like web mapping applications.
- **Scalability**: The tile-based approach allows for easy scaling and efficient handling of high load, as the same tiles can be reused for multiple requests.
- **Standardization**: It is standardized by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), ensuring interoperability between different systems and software.
