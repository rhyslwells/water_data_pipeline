## Preparation 

Write me some questions to ask during the interview.

- Where in the organisation do i fit. what is the structure.


What kind of case study questions am I likely to be a

Most interviews involve a combination of CV-based, behavioural and case questions. Think of
examples in your work/personal life that will show your skills and experiences at their best and will
demonstrate the values of the business.

Use the STAR model to provide a structure:

We’d also encourage you to practice telling your story in the best possible way.

4. Plan what to wear and how you’re going to get to the interview.
The first impression you make is the most important one, so you don’t want to be late!
Make sure you:
● know where you are going
● decide on the best route to take
● get an idea of how long it might take you and add on extra time just to cover any possible
delays

It also still important to dress professionally for a job interview, regardless of the work environment.
Wearing smart business clothes is always the best choice, but we will, of course, tell you if you need to
come to the interview in more casual clothes if you’re having a site tour for example.

5. On the day - plan what to bring.
● Copies of your CV
● A notepad and pen
● Any notes you might need as a reminder - sometimes nerves do get the better of us all
● A portfolio with samples of your work, if relevant

6. Pay attention to non-verbal communication.
● Be mindful. Nonverbal communication speaks volumes.
● Project confidence. Smile, establish eye contact and use a firm handshake.
● Posture counts. Sit up straight yet comfortably. Be aware of nervous gestures such as
foot-tapping.
● Be attentive. Don't stare, but maintain good eye contact, while addressing all aspects of an
interviewer's questions.
● Manage reactions. Facial expressions provide clues to your feelings. Manage how you react,
and project a positive image.

7. Follow up.
Many interviews end with “Do you have any questions?”
● Bring a list. You may say, “In preparing for today's meeting, I took some time to jot down a few
questions. Please allow me to review my notes.”
● Be strategic. Cover information not discussed or clarify a previous topic — do not ask for
information that can be found on the organisation’s website.
	○ In your opinion, what makes this organisation a great place to work?
	○ What do you consider the most important criteria for success in this job?
	○ Tell me about the organisation’s culture.
	○ How will my performance be evaluated?
