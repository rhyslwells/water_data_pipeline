Starting from a scenario where the data infrastructure is minimal and primarily based on Excel files and Microsoft Access, the goal is to create a more scalable, manageable, and robust data infrastructure. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

### 1. Assess Current Data

- **Inventory**: Take stock of all Excel files and Access databases. Identify key datasets, their relationships, and data volumes.
- **Quality Check**: Evaluate the quality and consistency of the data. Identify any immediate issues like duplicates, missing values, or inconsistent formatting.

### 2. Centralize Data Storage

- **Database Selection**: Choose a relational database management system (RDBMS) for centralized data storage. Options include:
    - **PostgreSQL**: Open-source, highly reliable, and feature-rich.
    - **MySQL**: Popular, widely used, and supported by many tools.
    - **SQL Server**: Especially if the company is already using Microsoft products, it integrates well with other Microsoft services.

### 3. Data Migration

- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Tools**: Use ETL tools to migrate data from Excel and Access to the chosen RDBMS. Tools like **Talend**, **Apache Nifi**, or **Pentaho Data Integration** can facilitate this process.
- **Scripts**: For simpler tasks, Python scripts using libraries like **pandas** and **SQLAlchemy** can be used to load data into the database.

### 4. Data Integration and Automation

- **Scheduled Jobs**: Set up scheduled jobs to automate data extraction, transformation, and loading processes. Tools like **Apache ==Airflow==** or **cron jobs** can manage these tasks.
- **APIs**: If there are other applications or data sources to integrate, consider setting up RESTful APIs.
- **Logging:** Use ProntoForm to collect data using their API.

### 5. Data Management and Governance

- **Data Catalog**: Implement a data catalog to keep track of available datasets, their sources, and metadata.
- **Data Quality**: Establish data quality checks and monitoring to ensure ongoing data integrity.
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to secure sensitive data and ensure appropriate access levels.

### 6. Reporting and Visualization

- **BI Tools**: Implement business intelligence tools for reporting and visualization. **Tableau**, **Power BI**, and **Looker** are popular choices.
- **Ad-hoc Analysis**: Facilitate ad-hoc data analysis by providing access to SQL query interfaces or tools like Jupyter notebooks.

### 7. Training and Documentation

- **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation on the data infrastructure, including data sources, ETL processes, and access instructions.
- **Training**: Provide training sessions for staff on how to use the new data tools and platforms.
