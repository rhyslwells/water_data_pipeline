This project aims to provide an overview of the skills required for a Data Engineer position at Veolia. Specifically, it will showcase the following:

- **ETL Design**: Extract, transform, and load processes for managing data flow.
- **Data Extraction and Processing**: Responsible for extracting data from a network of remote data monitoring equipment, cleansing, collating, and analyzing the data to prepare monthly internal reports and quarterly reports for billing purposes.
- **Data Handling, Dashboarding, and Digitalization**: Efficiently manage data, create interactive dashboards, and implement digital solutions.
- **Documentation Production**: Ability to produce documentation to guide users.
- **Data Comparison and Anomaly Detection**: Interact with water providers to regularly compare data on water quality, check for anomalies between datasets, and identify any volume and financial impacts.
- **Technical Skills**: Showcase proficiency in Power BI, SQL, Python, and Microsoft Access.

### Project Proposal: Water Quality Data Analysis and Reporting System

#### Project Overview

Develop a system that captures, processes, and reports on water consumption data from a network of remote monitoring devices. The system will include components for data extraction, cleansing, analysis, and visualization. Additionally, it will feature a dashboard for real-time monitoring and a reporting mechanism for generating monthly and quarterly summaries.
#### Objectives
1. [[Data capture]]: Use a  data capture service such as Google Forms or ProntoForms to collect water consumption data.
2. [[Data storage outline]]: Store the data in a structured format using Microsoft Access or an SQL database.
3. [[Data cleaning]]: Write Python/ Microsoft accesss/sql scripts to clean and process the data.
4. [[Data reporting]]: Use statistical methods to analyze the data and identify trends and anomalies. Develop interactive dashboards and automated reports using Microsoft Power BI.
