About this service: The Water Quality Archive provides data on water quality measurements. Samples are taken at sampling points around England and can be from coastal or estuarine waters, rivers, lakes, ponds, canals or groundwaters. They are taken for a number of purposes including compliance assessment against discharge permits, investigation of pollution incidents or environmental monitoring. Only _complete_ samples, where all analyses have been completed, are included. Currently the dataset does not include all groundwater or third party data.
